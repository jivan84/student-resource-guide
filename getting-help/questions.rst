Asking Questions
================

As you work through your coursework, many of you will probably have
questions or will encounter issues that you are not sure how to
handle. Your course staff will typically set up some form of online
discussion board for this very purpose, usually through Canvas or Ed
Discussion.

Online discussion boards provide a
convenient mechanism to ask questions, but it can sometimes be
challenging for course staff to help you if you do not provide the right
information when asking a question. Here are a few suggestions that may
help you ask questions more effectively on an online discussion board:

-  Before you post a question...

   -  **Search before asking**. Before posting a question on the
      discussion board, check whether it has already been answered in a
      previous post. We realize the volume of posts can be overwhelming,
      but you should start by using the discussion board’s search
      functionality to see if it brings up any relevant posts. For
      example, suppose you are failing a specific test in a programming assignment;
      you could search just for that test’s name to see if any
      other students have encountered that same error (and, if you’re
      lucky, an instructor/TA will have already answered it).
   -  **Make sure to formulate an actual question to ask**. Make sure
      you are describing a specific issue you’re encountering, and why you’re
      stuck on it (e.g., you are not getting the expected result, the
      tests are failing in a way you do not understand, etc.). Writing a
      post that says “I can’t get Task 4 to work, I’ve pushed my code.
      Please look at it.” is not a question: it is a request for someone
      to debug your code for you. Try instead to describe the exact
      reason why you're stuck (we provide concrete suggestions on how to
      do this below). If you're struggling to do so, you may want to
      go to :ref:`office hours <getting-help_office-hours>` to get help
      more interactively.

- **Public vs private questions**. Discussion boards often have
  mechanisms that allow you to ask private questions, which will be
  seen only by the instructors and teaching assistants. Typically, this
  mechanism should be used only for truly private matters that relate
  uniquely to you (e.g., you need to notify the course staff of a family/medical
  emergency, etc.).

  Of course, when you run into an issue on an assignment, it may seem like
  "it applies only to you" because it relates to your code. However,
  it's possible that other students will run into the exact same issue
  you ran into. So, questions about coursework, course logistics, etc.
  do not qualify as "private matters", and should typically be
  asked publicly. This way, everyone can benefit from the
  answer to the question and, if someone runs into the same issue you
  do, course staff can refer them to the answer they provided in your post.

- **The more information, the better**. We know that, in some
  classes, you may feel the need to be brief and concise when asking
  for help to “avoid wasting the professor’s time” or because
  “professors don’t have time to read long e-mails”. The absolute
  opposite is true in most CS classes: when asking for help, we prefer
  that you *overwhelm* us with information.

  In particular, it will be much easier for course staff to help you if they are
  able to reproduce the exact issue you are encountering (i.e., when
  they run your code, they must be able to observe the exact same issue
  you’re encountering). And to do so, they need as much information as
  possible from you:

   - If your question relates to your code, and your class is using a
     version-control system (e.g. git, svn, etc), make
     sure you push your code to the server (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, PhoenixForge) before asking for help.
   -  Make sure you’re running your code on a :ref:`UChicago CS software environment <software-environment>`.
      Course staff will not be able to provide
      assistance if you are running your code on your personal machine,
      as this will make it harder for them to reproduce the exact issue
      you are encountering.
   -  Include a detailed description of the exact chain of events that
      lead to the issue you’re encountering (Are you testing a specific
      function? If so, with what inputs? Does the issue come up when you
      run a test? Etc.).
   -  If you encounter an error message (or any other unexpected output)
      when running a command or a specific test, please make sure you
      include the command that you ran and the **full and unabridged** error message (or unexpected
      output). Summarizing the message (e.g., “The tests says it was
      expecting value 42, and I’m pretty sure that’s what I’m
      returning”) makes it harder for course staff to identify the issue.
   -  If something is “wrong”, please describe in what way it seems
      wrong to you. For example, were you expecting a particular output
      but got a different one? Is a piece of code behaving in a way you
      were not expecting? Etc. It can be useful to describe what you were
      expecting the code to do, and what you encountered instead.

- What *not* to include in your question:

   -  **Never post your code on an online discussion board**. If
      you need the course staff to look at your code, and your class
      uses a version control system, just push it to the server
      (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, PhoenixForge) and the course staff
      will look at it there. Please note that, if a test prints out a
      few lines of code as part of its output, that is typically acceptable.
   -  **No screenshots**. Do not post screenshots of the command or the output.
      Screenshots are not searchable, and may pose readability issues
      for some people. Instructors/TAs may also want to copy-paste your
      command elsewhere, which is not possible if you post a
      screenshot.

      If you need to share some output from the terminal, copy-paste from the
      terminal onto the discussion board, and use the discussion board’s
      “code block” or "verbatim" formatting. To copy something on the terminal, just
      select it (the same way you would do in a word processor: click,
      and then drag until the end of the output) and press
      Control-Shift-C (Command-C on MacOS).

-  **One question, one post**. Avoid posts that have multiple unrelated
   questions. Instead, write a separate post for each question. Please
   note that it is ok to ask multiple questions in one post if they all
   relate to the same issue.

-  **Comments vs Answers**. Some discussion board distinguish between
   "answering" a question and adding a "comment" on an existing question.
   In those cases, you should use the "comment" functionality if you'd like
   to provide additional information on a question, or have a follow-up question.
   You should use the "answer" functionality only if you are providing an
   actual answer to the question (including if you've resolved the issue
   on your own, so the question is flagged as "answered").

UChicago CS Student Resource Guide
==================================

This resource guide is intended for students working on programming assignments and projects in UChicago CS classes.
Please note that it is not meant to be a normative guide for all CS classes (unless your instructor has
explicitly pointed you to this guide).

This guide is divided into four sections:

- **Software Environment**: Information about the Linux software environment provided by the CS department,
  and which you will be using in most of your classes. This section includes instructions on how to access
  this environment, including when working off-campus.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Instructions on how to use Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor.
- **Tutorials**: A couple of useful tutorials covering certain tools and skills you may need in your classes.
- **Style Guides**: Style guides you may be required to follow in your programming assignments.
- **Other Resources**: Other useful resources.
